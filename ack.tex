I want to thank Joan Manuel Marqu\`{e}s Puig for helping me to get in touch with V\'{i}ctor, thus being able to agree and produce this dissertation. To V\'{i}ctor Oncins Biosca, for supporting bird-openwrt solution and pushing me getting back to its development and, later, to become my tutor in this dissertation, helping me to understand administrators perspective and their  requirements in order to implement a much better solution which, definitively, will keep rolling. Moreover, I would like to say thank you for all the time spent not only during our review meetings, but working together with the testing environments, which were a big challenge and an invaluable amount of experience that I could not have had otherwise. To Andreu Bassols Alc\'{o}n for his continuous support managing all the resources I did require during this project's development. Finally, special thanks to S\'{i}lvia, who has patiently supported me during the whole process.
