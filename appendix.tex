\chapter{Kanban Project Management using Taiga.io Service}
\label{app:sec:kanban}
As part of the initial investigation, I did some research on Open Source Project Management tools that could help me monitoring my progress as well as adding some value to the final project.
Because of this project's scope and time-frame, the size of the team (me) and the number of Stakeholders (VÃ­ctor), the only Agile \textit{approach} that I could use was Kanban\footnote{\href{http://www.scrumhub.com/kanban-fundamentals/}{Kanban} approach summarised: project with a continuous prioritised backlog, one task per team resource, the project must be releasable after closing any task, reduce to the minimum the number of required ceremonies and tasks go from \textit{ToDo} (left) to \textit{Done} (right).}. The following sections present the tests and initial usage of Taiga Kanban service.
